# Flipkart-Backend-code
Welcome to Flipkart's backend repository! Flipkart is an online shopping platform with a wide range of products across different categories. This repository contains the essential code that makes Flipkart work behind the scenes.

Our backend code takes care of important things like helping you create a secure account and log in. Once you're logged in, you can explore a huge range of products, from electronics to fashion to things for your home.

Our backend also keeps track of all the products available. We make sure new products get added, old ones get updated, and anything outdated gets removed. When you're ready to buy something, our backend handles everything smoothly. We process your order quickly, keep track of what's in stock, and make sure your items get to you on time.
